Treatment with SLS009 resulted in a complete remission (CR) with no minimal residual disease (MRD) after three cycles as a monotherapy in an AML patient who had failed prior venetoclax plus azacytidine (aza/ven) therapy. The CR lasted eight months with the patient achieving one year survival at the latest assessment. This is the first time that a relapsed/refractory (r/r) AML patient achieved a CR with CDK9 inhibition monotherapy. Notably, the median survival for patients relapsed after aza/ven therapy is approximately 2.5 months. All key study objectives were met regarding pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), safety, and clinical activity, noted March 1, 2024.Â read less",105.0,42.26289,115.3931,1.01,1.0,1.26,-0.009950331,0.22116139,-0.023199635,-0.005370637,9.19793,0.1291,1.08164,326,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,pos,"[  101 12278   122 13753   118 13936  7867  1891  1499  2568  2233  1111
